# 🎮 Colourade

**Colourade** is a turn-based strategy game where a human player competes against an adaptive AI in a battle of color predictions. Each round, both the player and AI choose a color for themselves from a set — **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**, and **Yellow** — while also trying to guess what the opponent has picked. Players earn **+1 point for correct guesses**, testing their intuition and bluffing skills.

Every third round introduces the **Power Color Bonus** — selecting the designated power color as a self-pick earns an **additional +3 points**, adding tension and strategic value to key moments in the game.

The game includes selectable difficulty levels that affect how the AI behaves, ranging from randomized choices to more calculated patterns. A well-timed guess or a clever disguise can make or break the match.
